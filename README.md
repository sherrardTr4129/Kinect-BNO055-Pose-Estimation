# Kinect-BNO055-Pose-Estimation
This repository contains required software to construct a Pose of a vision target by fusing its x,y,z coordinates from the kinect, with its quaternion orientation from the BNO055 sensor.

## Kinect Dependencies
To run the kinect interfacing software in this repository, make sure to install the libfreenect library and python wrappers. Two bash scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/alwynmathew/libfreenect-with-python] that do exactly that.)
